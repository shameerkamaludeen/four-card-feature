## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Started concentrating on choosing the right structure for the design, which helped me from rewriting the HTML and CSS less, but still need to improve on that.

### Continued development

Want to concentrate on the structuring of HTML more when I see the design itself that may help in changing the CSS less often eventually that may reduce my time on developing the page.
